Women Connect In Tech

Installation
The Rails API back end repository can be found here: https://github.com/osha7/women-connect-tech-frontend

Fork and clone both repositories before attempting to launch the application.

----- BACKEND API -----
Starting up Rails Server:

First run bundle install to install all the necessary gems. Then run rails db:migrate and rails db:seed to build and initialize the PostgresSQL database.

After the DB has been initialized and seeded run rails s to start the server.

Starting up React/Redux application:

Make sure you have started the rails server by following the steps above.

----- FRONTEND -----
Run npm install to install all necessary dependencies. 
Other dependencies needed:  

Run 'npm start -p 3002' to start the application. The application MUST be started in browser at http://localhost:30002.  This is due to CORS dependencies in the backend
